# perspective-sheet

A questionnaire to help people see other's perspectives.

**Version**: 2.1.0

**Authors**:  Wilfried Motchoffo 

## Overview

This app provides an easy and streamlined method to conduct a survey of participants' life experiences which have affected their exposure to technology and software development. The end product of the survey is a graphical representation of the survey results to facilitate a conversation about distribution and differences of people's experiences to build empathy and understanding.

A login page requires an administrator to input their own private JotForm API key with 'full access' permissions. An administrator homepage written with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is the initiation point for spawning a new instance of the survey. Through the use of a clone process with JotForm API, a survey URL for the new group or class is created. The administrator can then copy the link and send it to participants. Each participant interacts with the JotForm front end form and clicks submit. Data is then gathered by the server.js through JotForm's API. The results of the survey are then plotted using chartJS. A list of previous group results can be viewed as long as the forms exist on JotForm.
